-  Hi, I’m @Jackocu202
-  I’m interested in Computer Science and learning more about coding and using it in the world. Currently studying at CU Boulder.
-  I’m currently learning C++ and deepening my knowledge in that language but I am also very interested in learning new ones and the different applications of them. 
-  I’m looking to meet new people in the field and get used to being more in the community 
-  You can reach me at my CU email: jaco8388@colorado.edu
